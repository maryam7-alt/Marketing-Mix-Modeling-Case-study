# Marketing-Mix-Modeling-Case-study 


In this case study, I will work on a consultancy project where we have  problem from the client that is going to plan his next marketing budget for the next year and he was not satisfied by the previous 
results and think that the resources and budget allocated to the different marketing channels are not optimized. 
This is why we will make sense of his dataset and recommend him the optimal budget allocation for different channels.
